# Overview

This is Asteroids using the Arcade module in Python. Use WASD to move around. 
W and S accelerate forward and backward while A and D turn your ship left and right.
Press Spacebar to fire lasers to destroy asteroids before they hit your ship.

When you destroy asteroids, you get points which you can use to upgrade your ship.

I made this game to gain more practice with game development and Python's Arcade library.
